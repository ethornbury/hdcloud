										<p>Everyone knows the name Commissioner Gordon. He is one of the crime world's greatest foes, a man whose reputation is 
				synonymous with law and order. But what is known of Gordon's story and his rise from rookie detective to Police Commissioner?
				What did it take to navigate the multiple layers of corruption that secretly ruled Gotham City, the spawning ground of the world's 
				most iconic villains? And what circumstances created them â€“ the larger-than-life personas who would become Catwoman, The Penguin, 
				The Riddler, Two-Face and The Joker?
				<br><br>
				GOTHAM is an origin story of the great DC Comics Super-Villains and vigilantes, revealing an entirely new chapter that has never 
				been told. GOTHAM follows one cop's rise through a dangerously corrupt city teetering between good and evil, and chronicles the birth 
				of one of the most popular super heroes of our time.

					<br />Six Seasons (2011 - 2014) - 55 Min Episodes</div>
					<p>The Game of Thrones series, set on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos at the end of a decade-long summer, interweaves several plot lines. 
					The first follows the members of several noble houses in a civil war for the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms; the second covers the rising 
					threat of the impending winter and the Southerners' fear of the legendary creatures and fierce peoples of the North; the third chronicles the 
					attempts of the exiled last scion of the realm's deposed ruling dynasty to reclaim the throne. Through its exploration of the ambitions and 
					morals of its many characters, the series explores issues of social hierarchy, religion, loyalty, corruption, civil war, crime, and punishment.

						<br />Five Seasons (2011 - 2014) - 45 Min Episodes</div>
						<p>While running from a drug deal gone bad, Mike Ross, a brilliant young college-dropout, slips into a job interview with one of 
						New York City's best legal closers, Harvey Specter. Tired of cookie-cutter law school grads, Harvey takes a gamble by hiring Mike 
						on the spot after he recognizes his raw talent and photographic memory. Mike and Harvey are a winning team. Even though Mike is a 
						genius, he still has a lot to learn about law. And while Harvey may seem like an emotionless, cold-blooded shark, Mike's sympathy 
						and concern for their cases and clients will help remind Harvey why he went into law in the first place. Mike's other allies in the 
						office include the firm's best paralegal Rachel and Harvey's no-nonsense assistant Donna to help him serve justice. Proving to be an 
						irrepressible duo and invaluable to the practice, Mike and Harvey must keep their secret from everyone including managing partner Jessica 
						and Harvey's arch nemesis Louis, who seems intent on making Mike's life as difficult as possible.

						<br />Four Seasons (2010 - 2013) - 55 Min Episodes</div>
					<p>The inspiration behind this series is the Thracian Gladiator Spartacus, who led a slave uprising against the Roman Republic. 
					The Thracians had been persuaded by Claudius Glaber to serve as auxiliaries in the Roman legions in a campaign against the Getae, 
					who had often plundered Thracian lands. However after Glaber reneges on the deal and switches his attentions from the Getae to attack 
					Mithridates in Asia Minor, the Thracians feel betrayed and mutiny. Captured by Glaber, Spartacus is condemned to death as a Gladiator, 
					whilst his wife Sura is condemned to slavery. Spartacus, however, proves to be a formidable gladiator, and defeats the four gladiators 
					tasked with executing him. He becomes a favorite of the crowd, leading Senator Albinius to commute his death sentence to a life of slavery. 
					Spartacus is purchased by Batiatus for gladiator training, who promises to help him find Sura if he proves himself in training. As the 
					series develops, the story follows the betrayals and machinations of Roman life and a tale of one man's heroic quest for vengeance.
