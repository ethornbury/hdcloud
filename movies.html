						<img src="image/clerks.jpg" alt="image from the movie Clerks" class="imgright">
						<p>[ CLERKS ]:Great low budget commedy, written, produced and directed by Kevin Smith. The entire movie costed only $27,575 and shooted entirely with just two location: a video store 
						(where Kevin Smith worked for real) and a small market. The original script and the funny fresh ideas, wich are taken from every-day life of two friends, Dante and Randal,that have simple jobs but don't have
						idea of what to do in the future. every customer that enter their shop became a "prey" of the jokes of one of Randal, while Dante try to make everything to don't let them put in troubles.
						In the meanwhile the story is spiced up by the presence of two bizarre pushers Jay and Silent Bob, that lay all day on the wall of the clerks shop trying to attract some "customer" and
						making some deep dubious "philosophical" convarsation about the meaning of life...</p>

						<p>[ STARWARS ]: "Long time ago in a Glaxy far far away..." that's the start
						of one of the most epic and loved saga in the hystory of the cinema, created by the genius mind of George Lucas.
						The entire saga is adapt to every kind of public. The original idea behind was to create a saga that mixed knights mythology and
						romance in a imaginary futiristic space scenario, with also a spiritual accent from buddist religion (the power of "the Force" as powerful zen energy) 
						everything elaborated in a romantic and exciting sci-fi adventure story.

						<p>[ 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY ]:Probably one of the most beautifull, deep, symbolic and intelligent movie
						ever made. From the director Stanley Kubrick, this movie saw the light in theatres in 1968... even if more than
						40 years are past, this immaginary and philosophic masterpiece is an eternal and original vision about the story of humanity
						from the origin to the advent of the Nietzschian 'new man' ... A must.

						<p>[ INDIANA JONES ]: Another great George Lucas saga, that impressed definitly Harisson Ford as a symbol of the most famous archeologist in the world: 
						The eminent Professor Jones, Indiana Jones! The first three stories of the saga are definitly the must see ones. Each story is direct by the magistral eye
						of Steven Spielberg. Fun, suspense, surprise and action are guarantee. Every time professor Jones will face a different kind of obstacole to his resource of knowledge
						and or lost historical artefacts, that for the professor should always belong to a museum, rather then to a private especially if has evil scopes. A knight of science
						and knowledge that will always find an original way to get out of troubles not without frequent 'coup de théâtre' or if you prefer 'surprises'.</p>

						<img src="image/pulp.jpg" alt="image from movie Pulp Fiction " class="imgright"></a>
						
						<br /><p>[PULP FICTION]: Great Quentin Tarantino movie, in one of his most famous "works". The director utilize an original refined
						and well builded narrative style wich doesn't follow the stereotypical flow of events in movies. Every character has a well defined 
						behave profile, and storyline wich will twist and influence with other protagonist stories...one of the most famous quotes in cinema
						come from this great full-length film.

				<img src="image/singin.png" alt="image from movie Singing in the Rain" class="imgleft"></a>
						<p>[ SINGIN'IN THE RAIN ]: This is a milestone of the musical history. "Singin in the rain" is one of that movie that can't evoke emotions other than
						joy, and happiness. The storyline is very simple and fluent, what is great are the acting skills of the protagonists wich will exibith in high level shows
						of singing, dancing and role-playing... One of the highest moment of the movie is when the superb Gene Kelly will entertain you in an original epic tip tap
						under the rain, singing and messing around in the neighborhood drenched of rain but full of energy and joy because he is in love..
						</p>
						<img src="image/across.jpg" alt="+++" class="imgright">
						<br /><p>[ ACROSS THE UNIVERSE ]: Superb musical, wich revist the most memorables Beatles songs and reinterpretate them in a modern key. Great artists like
						Joe Cocker, Bono and Ben Harper contribute to the realisation of the soundtracks. Breathtaking also the photography and the visual effects. The story is
						between Liverpool and the United States during the 70's, where our protagonist Jude (in honor of the famous song) is trying to discover the possibilities 
						of a new exciting life over the ocean..
