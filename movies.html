						<br/ ><p>[CLERKS]:Great low budget commedy, written, produced and directed by Kevin Smith. The entire movie costed only $27,575 and shooted entirely with just two location: a video store 
						(where Kevin Smith worked for real) and a small market. The original script and the funny fresh ideas, wich are taken from every-day life of two friends, Dante and Randal,that have simple jobs but don't have
						idea of what to do in the future. every customer that enter their shop became a "prey" of the jokes of one of Randal, while Dante try to make everything to don't let them put in troubles.
						In the meanwhile the story is spiced up by the presence of two bizarre pushers Jay and Silent Bob, that lay all day on the wall of the clerks shop trying to attract some "customer" and
						making some deep dubious "philosophical" convarsation about the meaning of life...

						<p>[INDIANA JONES]: Another great George Lucas saga, that impressed definitly Harisson Ford as a symbol of the most famous archeologist in the world: 
						The eminent Professor Jones, Indiana Jones! The first three stories of the saga are definitly the must see ones. Each story is direct by the magistral eye
						of Steven Spielberg. Fun, suspense, surprise and action are guarantee. Every time professor Jones will face a different kind of obstacole to his resource of knowledge
						and or lost historical artefacts, that for the professor should always belong to a museum, rather then to a private especially if has evil scopes. A knight of science
						and knowledge that will always find an original way to get out of troubles not without frequent 'coup de théâtre' or if you prefer 'surprises'.
